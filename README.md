A Python implementation of the **Autonomous Basin Climbing (ABC)** algorithm for the efficient, on-the-fly exploration of complex potential energy surfaces (PES).

This package is designed for discovering reaction pathways, transition states, and local minima in chemistry, physics, and materials science simulations without requiring predefined collective variables or reaction endpoints. To our knowledge, this is the only publicly available Python implementation of the ABC algorithm.

## Key Features

-   **Automated Discovery**: Combines minima discovery and transition state identification into a single, autonomous workflow.
-   **Curvature-Adaptive Biasing**: Uses local Hessian information (from BFGS or other methods) to shape anisotropic Gaussian biases, effectively filling basins and encouraging escapes.
-   **Intelligent Perturbations**: Guides escapes along soft-mode directions (low-curvature pathways) for physically meaningful transitions.
-   **Flexible Exploration Modes**: Supports fully **deterministic**, **randomized-adaptive**, and **stochastic** exploration strategies.
-   **ASE Integration**: Works seamlessly with the [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) for advanced atomistic simulations.
-   **Subspace Biasing**: Easily restrict biasing and perturbations to specific atoms or degrees of freedom using `biased_atom_indices`.

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of finding the minima of a 2D MÃ¼ller-Brown potential.

```python
from ca_abc import CurvatureAdaptiveABC
from ca_abc.potentials import StandardMullerBrown2D

# 1. Initialize the potential
potential = StandardMullerBrown2D()

# 2. Configure and run the ABC simulation
abc = CurvatureAdaptiveABC(potential)
abc.run(max_iterations=100)

# 3. Access the results
# The run prints a live summary, but results are stored on the object.
print("\n--- Simulation Results ---")
print(f"Found {len(abc.minima)} unique minima.")
print("Approximate saddles:", abc.saddles)
```

## Future Directions

This project is in active development. Key future directions include:

  - **Parallelization**: Implement multi-walker schemes where different runs on the PES share a single, global bias list.
  - **Improved Biasing Metrics**: Incorporate descent history and barrier information to enhance bias height determination, inspired by methods from Cao et al.
  - **Transition Network Analysis**: Implement algorithms like ABC-E (Fan et al.) for automated transition network construction and kMC support.
  - **Machine Learning Integration**: Learn the bias covariance from descent information to better handle anharmonic regions.
  - **Hybrid Optimizers**: Dynamically switch between `FIRE` (robust near saddles) and `BFGS` (fast in harmonic regions) for optimal performance.
  - **Expanded Calculator Support**: Add a dedicated LAMMPS calculator interface via ASE.

-----

## Known Issues

  - The BFGS Hessian approximation can degrade in very high dimensions (\>300D), where the Lanczos method may be preferable.
  - For extremely high-dimensional systems (\>1000D), bias storage can be memory-intensive. It is recommended to use `biased_atom_indices` and frequent data dumping to manage memory.
  - The dynamic EMA scaling for bias covariance often performs best when allowed to exceed its expected `(0, 1]` domain, possibly due to Hessian inaccuracies or landscape anharmonicity.
